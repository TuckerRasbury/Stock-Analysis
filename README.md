# Stock-Analysis
Module 2: VBA of Wall Street

Submitted by Isaac D. Tucker-Rasbury

## Overview of Project
The subroutine we created for our client, Steve, analyzes the annual market performance of a list of stocks using observations of said stocks from January 1st to December 31st for the year of data provided. The subroutine compiles the daily trading volume for each stock and, also, identifies the return on each investment for the year. Steve intends to use the subroutine to help his parents identify their best options for stocks; his parents are interested in stocks in the energy sector and have asked him to help. To make reading the stock performance analysis easy for Steve's family, we have added conditional formatting in the subroutine to highlight important information for them to consider while making their investment decisions.

## Summary


> Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.
